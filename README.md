# Bechdel Movie Ratings (Capstone 2 Frontend)

The purpose of this project was to provide an easy way for users to discover how their favorite movies rated on the Bechdel Test. The Bechdel Test measures screen time for women on a simple 1-3 scale. 1) It has at least two women 2) Who talk to each other 3) About something besides a man. I hope this sparks conversations around the male dominated culture of cinema and greater discussions of representation of women in popular culture as a whole.
Users can signup and add movies to their watchlist. Created as a capstone project for my bootcamp.
